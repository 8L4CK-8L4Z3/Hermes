# Vacation Planning & Experience Sharing App â€” Roadmap & Strategy

---

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive roadmap and strategy for your end-of-study project: a vacation planning and experience sharing application. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), TailwindCSS, Shadcn-ui, Tanstack-Query, Zustand, and Zod (using only JSX, no TypeScript), the app is designed to help users plan trips, share experiences, receive recommendations, and manage their data. Admin features for user and content management are also considered.

---

## Tech Stack

### Backend : Express + Mongoose + Redis

### Frontend : React JSX + TailwindCSS + Shadcn-ui + Zod + Zustand + Tanstack-Query

## Key Strategy & Approach

- **Prioritize user features:** Focus on building the main application first (trip planning, sharing, recommendations, etc.) to ensure a solid, functional core for your project deadline.
- **Plan for admin from the start:** Design your database and authentication to support admin roles and permissions, even if admin features are implemented later.
- **Add admin features after core is complete:** Once user-facing features are functional, implement admin pages for user/content management and analytics.

### Why This Approach?

- **User-centric:** The core features are what evaluators and users will interact with first.
- **Time management:** Admin features can be complex; building the main app first ensures a working product within the deadline.
- **Smooth integration:** Early planning for admin roles and APIs avoids major refactoring later.

**Notes:**

- `isAdmin` and `isMod` in Users allow for both admin and moderator roles.
- `Posts` and `Comments` collections enable a social feed and threaded discussions.
- `Likes` supports liking posts, comments, or reviews (expandable via `target_type`).
- `Notifications` keeps users informed of social interactions.
- `ModerationLogs` provides an audit trail for admin/mod actions.

This enhanced schema is more robust for a social platform, supporting richer interactions, moderation, and user engagement features. If you have specific features in mind (e.g., messaging, groups), further collections can be added as needed.

## Implementation Steps

1. Design database schema (with user roles), set up authentication, plan API endpoints.
2. Build user features (home, auth, trip planning, sharing, search, social feed).
3. Add admin features (dashboard, user/content management, analytics).

---

## Implementation Tips

- Use reusable React components.
- TailwindCSS for responsive layouts.
- Shadcn-ui for forms, tabs, and buttons and wherever it would be easier to use .
- Tanstack-Query for efficient API data fetching and caching.
- Zustand for user/session state.
- Zod for robust form validation.
- Express for backend CRUD, with rssole-based access for admin endpoints.

---

## Conclusion

Build the main application first to ensure a functional core, then add admin features for management and maintenance. Plan for admin from the start to avoid complications, and use your tech stack efficiently to deliver a comprehensive solution within your budget and timeline.
